# Photon Slicer

Photon Slicer is a 3D file slicer, it takes in 3D models and converts them into machine code ready for 3D printing.

Photon Slicer generates opimised paths for the print heads to follow, reducing deceleration and increasing the speed at which the target printer can print.

# Breakdown

This repository contains the slicer software as well as the firmware for a proof of concept printer built using DC motors instead of laser galvanometers.
